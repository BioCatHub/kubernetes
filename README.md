# Hosting BioCatHub

It is nice to have a software like BioCatHub developed, but how can one host it? Therefore, many possibilities exist:

## Hosting on a bare metal machine in house.

In this variant, the web application is hosted in the institute on a server we have control over. In this variant we have the full control over every part concerning the hosting process, but we also have to take care about every single element:

- set up the servers
- install required software (linux, docker, kubernetes, python and so on)
- configure firewalls
- set certificates 
- and many more

Furthermore, we have to deal with IT departments, administration, legal department and in finally still pay for the server capacities.
## Cloud service providers
